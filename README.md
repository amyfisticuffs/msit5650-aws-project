# Project Summary: LingoSphere
## Final project in AWS for MSIT5650 Cloud Computing

I developed an AWS-based language learning application, **LingoSphere**, that integrates both IaaS and SaaS solutions. 

## Infrastructure and Services
For infrastructure, the project leverages AWS IaaS offerings:
- **Application Load Balancer** for routing traffic and enforcing HTTPS.
- **EC2 instances** for backend servers and a bastion host.
- **S3** for audio file storage.
- **Route 53** for domain management.

On the SaaS side, the application incorporates:
- **Amazon Translate** for real-time text translation.
- **Amazon Polly** for generating lifelike speech.

## Application Workflow
The application workflow includes:
1. A user enters text in one language, selects a target language, and clicks **Translate**.
2. A request is sent to **Amazon Translate**, which returns the translated text.
3. The translated text is sent to **Amazon Polly**, which generates an MP3 file stored in **S3**.
4. The translated text is displayed, and the user can play the spoken translation via an audio button.

## Security Practices
To secure the application:
- Acquired an **SSL/TLS certificate** and registered a domain with **Route 53**, enabling encrypted HTTPS access.
- Configured **S3 bucket policies** to deny public `getObject` requests.
- Used **pre-signed URLs** to grant secure, time-limited access to S3 objects (set to expire after six minutes).
- Deployed an **Application Load Balancer** to hide EC2 instance IPs and ensure HTTPS enforcement.
- Established a **bastion host** for managing backend servers, accessible only from my machineâ€™s IP address.
- Placed backend servers in a private subnet with a **NAT gateway** for secure outbound connections.
- Utilized **IAM roles** instead of static security credentials to interact with AWS resources, safeguarding sensitive credentials.

This project helped me gain practical experience with cloud computing and AWS services while emphasizing robust security practices.
